1. Each Internxt link is repeated twice: once as a complete single address, and the second time split into multiple segments with hard line breaks. If the complete single address is not visible or cannot connect, please remove the hard line breaks from the multi-segment address and join them together. Starting from Volume 2 version 3.0, the addresses are in a single line, likely due to an upgrade by the cloud storage provider; current old addresses remain valid.

2. Due to version adjustments making the files larger and limited cloud storage capacity, after September 7, 2025, ZIP compressed versions are no longer provided. Readers must install 7z compression software themselves.

3. Starting from November 1, 2025, backups have been added to the Internet Archive's long-term addresses.

For volumes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, etc., in the G2.0 translation editions produced from July to November 2025, approximately 1% of the text (in terms of weak quantity) suffered from entire paragraphs being omitted in translation. A dedicated program has been developed to address this issue, performing electronic collation and supplementary translation. So far, volumes 6–7 have been uploaded, with ongoing corrections being applied progressively.

Scattered proofreading and corrections (0.n proportion) have been upgraded. Starting from 2025-11-22, the entire version group will no longer be replaced on the cloud drive (net disk). Updates will only be uploaded to:  
https://huggingface.co/ospx1u for archiving.  

The very latest versions may no longer appear in the permanent link table; they will only be available at  
https://huggingface.co/ospx1u — please check there yourself.  
Under normal circumstances, the frequently updated full table for volumes 1–12 is located at:  
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ospx1u/buddhist-classics-vol1-12/tree/main

This means that the permanent download links previously provided for the specific content of volumes 1–13 are no longer the latest or most accurate versions; they are now merely kept as a fallback reference. This is especially true after switching data repositories and entering the phase of simultaneous proofreading and dual-translation balancing — those old links have essentially become optional historical data traces. In practice, however, the differences are limited, so updates based on Internxt and retention of past data will still continue. To repeat once again: the latest data is all at
