 Long-Term Links for the *Buddhist Classics AI Translation Series*, Volumes 1–15

**The Buddhist Classics AI Translation Series** (Multilingual Ancient Texts Translation Corpus Dataset) is usually updated and published at the following addresses:  
https://tinyurl.com/bcaits  
http://www.xinwenwuzhe.com/  
https://github.com/Buddhist-Classics-AI-Translation-Series/Buddhist-translations  

Starting from **July 2024**, releases are mainly distributed via the **Internxt cloud drive**.  
Upgrades for older versions of this cloud stopped on **2025.11.27**.  
Thank you — the old links published in the past are gradually being removed from the list.  
The actual storage addresses for **.7z files** remain valid, while **.zip files** have gradually expired.  

From **November 1, 2025**, long-term backups have been archived at the **Internet Archive (archive.org)**:  
https://tinyurl.com/bcaitsarchive  

They are also being successively uploaded to **zenodo.org**, the academic repository of the European Space Agency, for scholarly referencing:  
https://tinyurl.com/bcaitszenodo  

And to the **open-source NLP and machine learning community platform Hugging Face**:  
https://huggingface.co/ospx1u  

In volumes **1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12**, about **1%** of the content in the **g2.0 translations (produced July–November 2025)** contains segment-level omissions.  
A special program was developed for **digital proofreading and supplementary translation** to address these cases.  
Minor proofreading updates (at a 0.n ratio) have also been implemented.  

Since **2025.11.22**, updates to the Internxt-based version group have ceased.  
Future versions are prioritized for archiving at **huggingface.co/ospx1u**.  

The latest versions may not appear in the long-term link list.  
Please check directly at:  
https://huggingface.co/ospx1u  

In general, the frequently updated list for Volumes 1–12 can be found at:  
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ospx1u/buddhist-classics-vol1-12/tree/main  

They are also being uploaded to:  
https://tinyurl.com/bcaitszenodo  
https://zenodo.org/communities/bcaits/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest  

This means that for **Volumes 1–13**, the long-term download links previously released via Internxt are **no longer the latest or most accurate versions**.  
They remain as backups only.  
Since the project transitioned to new data repositories and entered the **proofreading and balanced bilingual** period, older data are now legacy records, though the actual differences are limited.  
Therefore, some Internxt-based versions will still be updated and retained for convenience.  

To repeat: **the latest data versions are all hosted at**
