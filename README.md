Buddhist Classics AI Translation Series
The Buddhist Canon AI Translation Series (BCAITS) is a collaborative online project (Publication Suspended effective Feb 08, 2026). It anticipates—and has already begun delivering—the first multilingual translation collection in human history covering both Northern Buddhism (including the Chinese and Tibetan Canons) and Southern Buddhism. The project is dedicated to fostering inter-translation and mutual understanding across Buddhist linguistic families.

The complete collection comprises approximately 50G, 280,000 files. The English sections are powered by Gemini 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0, while the Chinese sections utilize Claude 3.5 Sonnet and superior models. Notably, Volume 13 compiles English translations of all key texts from the Chinese Buddhist Canon, the Kangyur, and the Tengyur. The project has undergone continuous version upgrades, with a total of 17 volumes of data edited to date.
